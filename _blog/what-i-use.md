This is a collection of software that I use on a daily basis. I will try to keep it updated. 

### Operating System

On my main desktop machine I have Windows 10 dual booted with Arch Linux and just Arch on my Laptop.

### Music Listening

I use [ncmcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) as my music client together with [Mopidy](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/). 

Mopidy has an amazing collection of plugins where you can basically combine music from Youtube, Spotify and Soundcloud into one central music player.

### Text Editor

I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) for prettty much any text-editing/code writing. Setting it up as an IDE for some languages (like Java) can be a challenge.

### Browser

[qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org/index.html) for most of my browsing needs. The browser has vim keybindings and a lot of customisation options.
For websites that don't work well with it, I use [Brave](https://brave.com/).

### Document Writing

I use [LateX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) for all of my academic papers. There is a learning curve but if you are still using Microsoft Word, I suggest to give it a try. 

### Music Production 

I started music production using [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/). Since then, I've 
switched to [Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/). [Ardour](http://ardour.org/) 
is also a great choice but it's missing a good sampler which for my production workflow is quite important.

### Image Editing 

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is perfect for basic to advanced photo editing. 

### Font

My favorite font has to be [Cozette](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette). It looks great in any context, plus it includes nerd-font glyphs.

### Terminal Emulator

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is great. It works out of the box and has a simple, readable config file.

### Window Manager 

[i3](https://i3wm.org/) is the first and last window manager I've installed.

### Note Taking

For taking notes I simply have a folder of markdown files inside my "projects" folder. I keep it updated using git.

### Task Managing

I have started using [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) for task managing. It sometimes feels like it's offering way too much functionality, but it's nice that it can intergrate with other tools.

### Git Hosting

I have a [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/) instance on my home server.

### Password Management

I use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) for password management and the afformentioned git hosting to sync my passwords across devices.

### Mail

For viewing my mail in the terminal, I use [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/). It works really well out of the box and, for me, is better than mutt.
