Here are examples of use of foundation models in a UNIX-like environment.
A model is defined as foundational when it has been trained on a very large/diverse dataset,
and can be immediately used or fine-tuned for many downstream tasks.
Most examples involve using classic and more recent UNIX
utilities to glue together different tools.
Then, a foundation model is used to attack a problem that goes beyond well-defined solutions.
Finally, utilities are used to guardrail and massage the model's output to turn it into something useful.

## Creating playlists
Consider a scenario where you have downloaded
a number of songs and want to organize them into playlists. Manually
selecting tracks so that they smoothly transition from one to the other
can be time-consuming and requires intimacy with one's music collection.
However, by using a model that understands music and sound to translate
each song into a point in space, and then interpolating between these
points, it is possible to automatically create coherent playlists. This
recipe takes advantage of the `llm`[^1] utility and some
accompanying plugins,[^2] but the technique can be implemented using
analogous tools.

![wrapped image](/assets/images/llm-unix/interpolate.jpg){: .wrap-right width="150px"}
A model that understands audio can be used to embed our music
collection (`$MC`) into a high-dimensional space, where similar songs are
placed closer together. With the `llm-clap` plugin, we can generate
embeddings for our collection using the CLAP model with
`llm embed-multi -m clap songs --files $MC '*'` Now, each one of
our songs and its corresponding embedding are saved in a local
`embeddings.db` database, which we can query. Then, the
`llm-interpolate` plugin returns interpolated points between a starting
and ending point (song), creating between them a path (playlist). For
example, this one-liner generates a 5-song `.m3u` playlist between
`PacifyHer.wav` and `redrum.wav`:

```bash 
llm interpolate songs "PacifyHer" "redrum" -n 5 | jq .[] > playlist.m3u
```

## Taking notes
It can be tricky to take notes while watching videos of talks.
A model that can generate summaries of the video content can be used to
generate notes, which can be reviewed and expanded upon later. This can
also help rapidly expand one's set of notes. The following two-liner
uses the `llm` utility to generate a summary of a video
transcript downloaded using `yt-dlp` and finally pipes the output
to create a new note object using `zk`.[^3]

```bash 
yt-dlp --no-download --write-subs --output "$OUT" "$URL"
cat "$OUT" | llm -s "Create notes" | zk new -i
```

## Generating reports
It is common practice for people working
together to have monthly, weekly, or even daily meetings where all
members give a short update on what they have been working on. These
reports can be frustrating as they demand the right level of
abstraction---neither too detailed for team members lacking context nor
too broad to allow meaningful feedback. Forgetting the specifics of your
recent work adds to the challenge.

Digital todo-list tools like `taskwarrior`[^4] can be leveraged
to generate these reports by smartly querying them and piping their
output into an LLM. The following pipeline (1) queries taskwarrior for
all of last week's completed tasks, (2) exports them in json format, (3)
uses `jq`[^5] to extract the `.description` attribute from
each one, and (4) provides the completed task list to an LLM asking it
to generate the report.

```bash 
task status:completed end.after:today-7d export |
jq '.[] | .description' |
llm -s 'Generate a report based on these tasks.'
```

## Renaming pictures 
Consider the scenario where you have a large
collection of pictures saved. If these pictures are taken by you, or
downloaded from the internet, chances are the image files have vague or
useless names.

```bash
$ ls 
1672714705640839.png 1689964585834142.png 2.jpg
```

The laborious process of renaming each one can be automated by
leveraging a model with image-understanding capabilities. For this
recipe, one can use `ollama`,[^6] a very usable LLM model
fetching and inference tool that works great out-of-box with the
`moondream` vision model, which is small enough to allow for
quick inference on a modern laptop. The following pipeline finds every
`.jpg` file in the current directory and asks the model to
provide a title for it based on the image contents, some light
formatting at the end makes whatever the model outputs into a plausible
filename.

```bash 
find . -name "*.jpg" | 
xargs -I{} ollama run moondream "Title for this: {}" |
tr ' ' '_' | sed 's/$/\.jpg/'
```

The (slightly truncated) output filenames are (zoom-in to confirm):
`A_green_dragon_with_wings_and_a_tail.jpg` ![image](/assets/images/llm-unix/a.jpg){: width="20px"},
`A_painting_of_a_serene_landscape.jpg` ![image](/assets/images/llm-unix/b.jpg){: width="20px"},
`urns_of_stone_red_car_in_foreground.jpg` ![image](/assets/images/llm-unix/c.jpg){: width="20px"}.
